                Huckleberry Finn gives a summary of the events that took place in The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. Huckleberry addresses the reader to explain that they might know him from Tom's book. He recounts how the story ended with he and Tom discovering the robbers' treasure in a cave. Each boy was given six thousand dollars, which was distributed to them at a dollar a day from a trust guarded by Judge Thatcher. Huckleberry was taken in by the Widow Douglas, but had trouble adjusting to her formal way of living, so he set out on his own.
                The Widow Douglas's spinster sister, Miss Watson moves into her home in Chapter 1. She is a slim woman who wears glasses. Miss Watson attempts to tutor Huckleberry, but he has too much trouble staying still for the lessons. When Miss Watson warns Huckleberry about the dangers of damnation, he tells her that he wishes he could go to hell instead of sitting through lessons. Miss Watson is appalled and tells him that she is living a good life in order to go to heaven. Huckleberry fails to see the appeal of heaven. He becomes even less interested in going to heaven when Miss Watson says that Tom Sawyer probably will not go to heaven either. He vows that he will not try to go to heaven, but he decides not to tell Widow Douglas about his plan.
                Eventually, the enslaved members of the household are brought inside and everyone says their prayers before going to bed. Huckleberry, however, remains awake in his room. He is lonely and depressed as he listens to the night sounds. He thinks that he hears a ghost, and he starts to feel afraid. When a spider crawls on his arm and he shakes it off, it falls into his candle's flame and burns up. Huckleberry perceives the incident to be a bad omen. He completes a variety of rituals to ward of witches, but he still feels very scared.Huckleberry lights his pipe in order to calm his nerves. When something starts moving outside his window, he starts to panic. Then he hears "me-yow! me-yow!" and immediately feels relieved because he recognizes the call as Tom Sawyer's signal. Huckleberry crawls out of his window to join Tom.

                tiptoe through the Widow’s garden. Huck trips on a root as he passes by the kitchen, and Jim, one of Miss Watson’s slaves, hears him from inside. Tom and Huck crouch down and try to stay still, but Huck is struck by a series of uncontrollable itches, as often happens when he is in a situation “where it won’t do for you to scratch.” Jim says aloud that he will stay put until he discovers the source of the sound, but after several minutes, he falls asleep. Tom wants to tie Jim up, but the more practical Huck objects, so Tom settles for simply playing a trick by putting Jim’s hat on a tree branch over Jim’s head. Tom also takes candles from the kitchen, despite Huck’s objections that they will risk getting caught.
                Huck tells us that afterward, Jim tells everyone that some witches flew him around and put the hat atop his head. Jim expands the tale further, becoming a local celebrity among the slaves, who enjoy witch stories. Around his neck, Jim wears the five-cent piece Tom left for the candles, calling it a charm from the devil with the power to cure sickness. Huck notes somewhat sarcastically that Jim nearly becomes so “stuck up” from his newfound celebrity that he is unfit to be a servant.

                After punishing Huck for dirtying his new clothes during his night out with Tom, Miss Watson tries to explain prayer to him. Huck gives up on it after some of his prayers are not answered. Miss Watson calls him a fool, and the Widow Douglas later explains that prayer bestows spiritual gifts, such as acting selflessly to help others. Huck, who cannot see any advantage in such gifts, resolves to forget the matter. The two women often take Huck aside for religious discussions, in which Widow Douglas describes a wonderful God, while Miss Watson describes a terrible one. Huck concludes there are two Gods and decides he would like to belong to Widow Douglas’s, if He would take him. Huck considers this unlikely because of his bad qualities.
                Meanwhile, a rumor circulates that Huck’s Pap, who has not been seen in a year, is dead. A corpse was found in the river, thought to be Pap because of its “ragged” appearance. The face, however, was unrecognizable. At first, Huck is relieved. His father had been a drunk who beat him when he was sober, although Huck stayed hidden from him most of the time. Upon hearing further description of the body found, however, Huck realizes that it is not his father but rather a woman dressed in men’s clothes. Huck worries that his father will soon reappear.

                Over the next few months, Huck begins to adjust to his new life and even makes some progress in school. One winter morning, he notices boot tracks in the snow near the house. Within one heel print is the shape of two nails crossed to ward off the devil. Huck immediately recognizes this mark and runs to Judge Thatcher. Huck sells his fortune (the money he and Tom recovered in Tom Sawyer, which the Judge has been managing for him) to the befuddled Judge for a dollar.
                That night, Huck goes to Jim, who claims to possess a giant, magical hairball from an ox’s stomach. Huck tells Jim that he has found Pap’s tracks in the snow and wants to know what his father wants. Jim says that the hairball needs money to talk, so Huck gives Jim a counterfeit quarter. Jim puts his ear to the hairball and relates that Huck’s father has two angels, one black and one white, one bad and one good. It is uncertain which angel will win out, but Huck is safe for now. He will have much happiness and sorrow in his life, he will marry a poor woman and then a rich woman, and he should stay clear of the water, since that is where he will die. That night, Huck finds Pap waiting for him in his bedroom.
